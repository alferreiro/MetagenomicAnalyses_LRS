# MetagenomicAnalyses_LRS
Example bash scripts for analysis of long read sequence data. As of Feb 3, 2023 this work is ongoing and I will be updating with additional scripts as I proceed in the pipeline. Currently the plan is binning with metabat2 and maxbin2, bin refinement with metawrap or DAStool, read alignment with minimap2, polishing with racon and medaka, checkM to check for completeness and contamination, deREP to generate unique set of MAGs across multiple samples, gtdb-tk for taxonomy assignation.
